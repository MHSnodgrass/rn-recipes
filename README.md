# Recipe App
 - This is the Second React-Native app I created with Expo following the course React Native - The Practical Guide [2021 Edition] on Udemy by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.
 - I am Learning about proper screen navigation use `react-navigation`.
 - The first step was to create multiple screens and learn how to navigate through them via a self created navigator component: `MealsNavigator.js`. We also created dummy-data using a model via a JavaScript class.
 - The second step was to add default styles, along with the `Platform` API to create device specific styles, to each navigation header.
 - The third step was to learn how to pass data between screens, inside and outside of rendered components, via the navigation params. We also added `enabledScreens` from `react-native-screens` for possible future performance (forcing native UI elements where possible).
 - COURSE IS ONGOING
